<h2>A bot directory?</h2>

<p>We had two goals in mind when we created Bots for Chatting:</p>
<ul>
<li>give you an access to a directory that lists bots, on several platforms. </li>

<li>test and evaluate all bots to make this website the clearest, most up-to-date and funniest source of information!  </li>
</ul>
<div class='button-bar text-center'>
  <%= directory_link I18n.t('discover_all_bots'),
        klass: 'btn btn-primary'
    %>
</div>
